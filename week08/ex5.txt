Virtual memory represents needed memory for the program to work, however
we're physicaly limited in memory, that can be used at the moment. Because of that
we storing data, that doesn't needed for the program at the current moment
outside and load it, if it does. Virtual memory cannot be less than physical since
it would mean that we currently have more data, than the program actually proccessing.
