Avoidance
This strategy based on concepts of safe and unsafe states. OS gives resources
in such way, that is not goes to an unsafe state. This strategy allow to avoid
deadlock, however it requires in advance information about maximum resource 
needs for each process, what in practice is not always the case.
Prevention
There are 4 condintions in order for deadlock to occur. This strategy based on 
idea, that if one of the conditions is never met then no deadlock can occur. 
All 4 conditions have approach to prevent them, however there are some prob-
lems. For example when we attacking the Circular wait condition we can order 
resources numerically, but it's not always possible to find an ordering that
satisfies everyone.
Recovery
This strategyworks when we detecting a deadlock ( so first we have to detect
it). This strategy is good when it's hard to prevent or avoid deadlock however,
it has disadvantages.For example,one of the way to recover from deadlock is to
kill a process,but in that case we have to find such process that will help to
escape from a deadlock and such process is better to be rerunnable from the 
begining without ill effects( what is not always the case).
